## ðŸ“Œ GPS Real-Time Tracking System â€“ Logic Breakdown
# ðŸ§  Overall Goal
Display live GPS coordinates on a web-based map using Leaflet and update them in real-time from a GPS device.

The mapping proccess works as following:

1- The python code 'serial_read.py' receives the coordinates from the microcontroller.

2- The python code then opens a java file 'where.js' and writes each pair in a new line in the form of a list '[lat, long],'.

3- The java file is then read with an html file 'where.html' to interface and visualise the received coordinates with Leaflet.
